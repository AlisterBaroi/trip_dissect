# trip_dissect
Our Project for the 48 hours ImagineHack 2021 that got us the 4th place of out of 70+ participants and 20+ teams, hosted by the "Agents of Tech Club", a club of Taylor's University. In simpified terms, this is just like any fitness traking application, but in this case we are monitoring the electrical energy usage for homes, and companies. This way people can track the energy usage of their homes/companies and effectively reduce their energy consumption + utility bills, and have less carbon footprint.
