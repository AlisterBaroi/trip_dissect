# trip_dissect
Our Project for the ImahineHack 2021 that landed us in 4th place of the 48 hour hackathon, hosted by the "Agents of Tech Club", a club of Taylor's University. In simpified terms, this is a fitness traking application, but for monitoring the electrical energy usage for homes, and companies. This way people can track the energy usage of their homes/companies and effectively reduce their energy consumption + utility bills, and have less carbon footprint.
